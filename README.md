# Cyclic Fractal Algorithm
A simple cyclic fractal algorithm for automatical generation of multi-wing/scroll chaotic system from the wing/scroll-type seed system. 

## Description
By this algorithm the desired number of wings and scrolls can be easily yielded. The algorithm will neither introduce extra modulation functions nor extra variables, driven term, etc. In particular, it has wide applicability to three-dimensional seed chaotic system.

## Simulation
Using the [Cyclic Fractal Algorithm](./SystGeneration.mlx), the phase portraits of the multi-wing and multi-scroll system in 3-D space are simluated.
